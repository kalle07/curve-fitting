Its a first try to handle some equations to calculate the index of refraction of glass and polymeres with different types of fit-algorythms

my intention was 

* to get good starting numbers
* to create good starting numbers
* work with random numbers
* calculate it on multicore
* work with only 3 or 4 datapoints of the glass measured with a goniometer(metricon) on 3 or 4 wavelenghts
* (its not only sellmeier!)


curveexpert.zip is a large number of fit-formulas ready to use in CurveExpert, all for refractive index, many of them are self created (non physical based only mathematical) especially if you have only 3 or 4 data points

i have a small exe 200MB (is a standalone running program writen from a student) to get very fast some solutions for 3,4,5,6 datapoints, ask me if you are interessted
