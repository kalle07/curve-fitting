Its a first try to handle some equetions for calculatin index of refraction of glass with different types of fit-algorythms

my intention was 

* to get good starting numbers
* to create good starting numbers
* work with random numbers
* calculate it on multicore
* work with only 4 datapoints of the glass measured with a goniometer(metricon) on 4 wavelenghts
*
