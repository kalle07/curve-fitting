Its a first try to handle some equations to calculate the index of refraction of glass with different types of fit-algorythms

my intention was 

* to get good starting numbers
* to create good starting numbers
* work with random numbers
* calculate it on multicore
* work with only 4 datapoints of the glass measured with a goniometer(metricon) on 4 wavelenghts


curvefit.zip is a large number of fit-formulas ready to use in CurveExpert Professional

the exe is a standalone running program writen from a student to get fast some solutions
